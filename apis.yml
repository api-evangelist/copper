      applications. It is known for its excellent conductivity of electricity
      and heat, making it an essential component in electronics, wiring, and
      plumbing systems. Copper is also valued for its corrosion resistance,

      aesthetic appeal, often used in architectural design and decorative
      elements. Overall, copper plays a crucial role in modern society,
